This is my fake Google Homepage for the Odin Project!!!! 

As of April 3rd, this is pretty much completed. It took a lot of fiddling with flexbox to get everything to sit correctly. The general structure of the page is dictated by a single flex column. The top nav is a flex item but it sticks to the top. The main content is grows by 1, shrinks by 0, and auto fills the space as its basis. And the footer remains a footer (a flexible one tho) by having a shrink of 0. I still dont quite understand this...I think its because its essentially squeezed to the bottom by the main content.

As for the rest of the page, it doesnt function, just the general links. Could go in and apply hover effects ect. But rn, its on face value a google homepage...from late teens? They definitely got rid of that blue sign in button a long time ago haha.

But ya, besides the search bar annoyance, and the alignments, this was def a good refresher project!
